## 1.5.5: Shuffle an array

This is solution to the shuffle an array challenge on Javascript.info.
Part 1, chapter 2, heading 2, exercise 10, shuffle an array

## Description

This function gets an array and shuffle its elements (randomly orders).

## My Process

First of all I solve the challenge based on what I've learned from javascript.info & then I try to improve my code. Finally I write code according to the javascript.info solution.
First I wrote a code could shuffle an array & returned a new array. It made random indexes. In this way all element orders had an equal probability. After that I added a snippet of code which returned the modified array, not the new one but element orders didn't have an equal propability. Finally I modified the code based on the Javascript.info solution.
